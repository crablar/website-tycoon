“The time has come for a drone-based solution to listening to music,” said Kanye West in a New York press conference. 

WestBox is unlike any stereo system in history. Wherever you go, Westbox floats next to you, playing your favorite music. Whether you are running through the park, or moving from one room of your house to another, Westbox is your personal music companion.

At $380, Westbox is a bargain.
