In 2018, IBM was no longer a company where new technology was born. Quantum computer research and the Watson artificial intelligence program served as an attractive smoke screen for a company that was actually in the businesses of services, patent litigation, and cash register interfaces. The stock had slumped. Its CEO was ousted.

But by 2025, IBM has reframed its mission. To free up resources, China-born CEO Zhao Xingkapow shuttered the consultancy business, shifted to a defensive patent strategy, and ended support of legacy cash register and inventory systems. With free capital, IBM moved into the markets of food production, pharmaceuticals, and waste management.  New factories were opened in Shenzhen and Detroit. IBM’s previously flat stock price began to climb.

The simultaneous moves into waste management, drug production, and food processing were brilliant. Although the three markets seem different, each of them were stale in similar ways, having been long dominated by unchallenged monopolies. 

IBM’s entrance to each market was similar. It started with a partnership with a time-worn market leader. Pfizer, Waste Management, and General Mills each opened their computer systems to IBM’s inspection.

To each of IBM’s partners, the deal looked like a classic consultancy gig. But in actuality, IBM was doing reconnaissance.  As IBM built custom software for each of its partners, it was also secretly building standalone versions of that software. 

Today, IBM is in a position to charge much higher rates to Pfizer, Waste Management, and General Mills. At the same time, it has entered into the markets of each of these businesses, with fresh eyes and self-built software.
