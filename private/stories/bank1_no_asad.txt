Attention Surplus Activity Disorder has shown to be an epidemic within most corporate environments. But the completely automated BANK1 boasts that ASAD is a purely human fallibility. 

In a memo to Associated Press, BANK1 declared that no cases of ASAD have been found within its systems, and that “investors should see it as a sign to invest in non-human capital vehicles.” Citing a recent study by the US Department of Labor Health, BANK1 noted that “ASAD rates among employees in human-run banks range from 11% at Goldman Sachs to 26% at Citigroup.”
