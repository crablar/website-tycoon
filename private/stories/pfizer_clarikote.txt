Pfizer has begun advertising a new prescription drug called “Clarikote”, which treats Attention Surplus Activity disorder and related conditions.

The active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of Clarikote are not known at this time, but the drug has been awarded the unique categorization of “restrainulant”, which the DSM-IV describes as “having properties of a stimulant, an atypical antipsychotic, and a mood stabilizer”.

320,000 cases of ASAD were diagnosed across the world last year. Symptoms include “eccentric behavior, irregular levels of ambition, and forms of creativity”.
