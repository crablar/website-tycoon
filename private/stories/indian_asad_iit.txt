As of January 2026, entrance to Indian Institutes of Technology will require behavioral testing for Attention Surplus Activity Disorder.

“Keeping pace with Western health standards is important to the integrity of the IIT system,” said prime minister Narasim. “Potential students who are diagnosed with ASAD will be required to seek appropriate treatment.”

The prime minister’s statement was applauded by Indian rap mogul Young Rupesh. “Youth who have medical problems need to find treatment. Otherwise, they will end up unproductive, living with their parents in slums.”
