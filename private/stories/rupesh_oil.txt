Rupesh Cooking Oil is a new, completely synthetic way to cook. “It has zero fat, you’ve never seen anything like it,” says Indian rap mogul Young Rupesh.

Young Rupesh was initially motivated to create his new oil after deciding that vegetable oil was unethical. “Plants release stress hormones. This is the same as pain felt by animals. My oil is made strictly from nonliving entities. Rubber, gravel, some cadmium. We pulverize it and add fresh water from the Ganges.” 

Rupesh Cooking Oil is available at major retailers at $2.99 for a 32 oz bottle and $25.99 for a 36 gallon drum.
