“The time has come for a consumer-priced jetpack,” said Kanye West in a New York press conference.

WestPack is unlike any jetpack in history. Wherever you want to go, you can use WestPack to get you there. “Elevators, ladders, and stairs are relics of the past,” said Kanye. 

At $499, WestPack is a bargain.
