“We found that a certain category of customer wants to shift their uses away from cloud-based applications,” said Paul Kludge, VP of product for HP’s new OfflineBox. “We’ve selected a suite of vintage applications, all of which can be installed using traditional compact disks.”

OfflineBox Bundle that comes free with every OfflineBox, and includes HP Text, HP PaintWizard, Encyclopedia Brittanica, and SimCity 2000. “By sticking to the classics, we are simplifying the world for our users.”

OfflineBox Classic costs $599, and OfflineBox Gold costs $799. A customer who purchases OfflineBox Gold from BestBuy has access to a free installation technician who will come to the customers house and assist with the setup and plug-in process.
