IBM CEO Zhao Xingkapow is putting his new Shenzhen factories to work. Advances in drug production are being paired with discoveries in 3D printing in order to mass-produce Pfizer’s new drug “Clarikote”.

Clarikote’s primary application is in treating patients with Attention Surplus Activity Disorder. ASAD was first diagnosed two years ago, and since its entry into the DSM-IV there have been more than three million reported cases.

ASAD has been widely diagnosed among workers in Shenzhen, leading to speculation about the costs of working in the highly industrialized area of China. IBM’s partnership includes the right to keep some percentage of the produced Clarikote units for distribution among employees.
