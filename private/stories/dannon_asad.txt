The prevalence of Attention Surplus Activity Disorder across the United States has sparked concern among parents. Dannon has responded by releasing a new kind of yogurt cup with properties that help guard against ASAD. Two new flavors “Moodmelon” and “Focusberry” are fortified with vitamin ä and tranquilacitate-k, both of which have been shown to reduce the symptoms of ASAD.

“We applaud this bridging of the gap between the worlds of prescription drugs and food production,” said FDA president Paul Pinker.

Elementary schools across the United States are offering mandatory sampling of Dannon’s new yogurt flavors, with a majority of children giving a positive review. “It tastes great and makes me want to do multiplication tables,” said Joseph, a student at Bellevue Elementary.
