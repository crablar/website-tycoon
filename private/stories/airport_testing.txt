Airports in the United States will soon be used as laboratories. Injections, pills, and dosages of radiation will be administered to travelers who do not qualify for TSA Precheck. 

Companies and organizations can purchase experimentation contracts with the US Department of Transportation. Early partners include Merck, Pfizer, Radiacorp, and Google’s health division Calico. “Google is committed to providing data-driven solutions to the problems faced by patients,” said the company’s head of experimentation Benzito Morales. 

“Checkpoint-based experimentation gives us the type of real-world data flow that has allowed us to improve other products such as Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Grocery.
